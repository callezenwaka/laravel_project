        1.  NFCS Nigeria Federation of Catholic Students
            is living the Faith.
            We are the hope of our Faith to blossom
            The dreams of the Church, hail NFCS.
            With the strength of our Youth,
            We will move our faith forward.
            And defend it whatever be the case.

        <p>
            <strong>Chorus:</strong><br>    
            When the roll is called
            On the last day
            A joyful song we’ll raise
            Hail NFCS!
        </p>
        <p>
        2.  Let’s spad the good news of the Kingdom
            To all people on earth, through NFCS,
            And join hands with groups of like minds.
            To evangelize the world, through NFCS
            Let the message be brought to every living soul.
            By the life we live as students
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Chorus:</strong><br> 
            When the roll is called
            On the last day
            A joyful song we’ll raise
            Hail NFCS!
        </p>

        <p>
        3.  We say no to corruption, and greed,
            Sectionalism and violence in NFCS.
            And chant down the agent of Bribery,
            Ethnicism and war in NFCS.
            With Jesus, Prince of Love and Peace,
            We pitch our tent.
            Yes the enemies will forever be shamed.
        </p>

            Hail NFCS!
